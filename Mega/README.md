## General Info

This product has been discontinued for the time being due to the difficulty of manufacture, high material cost, complex assembly, and generally custom installation requirements.

The design is still valid and does not pose a safety concern if sewn correctly from quality materials.

## Assembly

Sewing instructions for this hammock can be found [here](./SEWING.md).

## Usage

All four corners of this hammock need to be secured to load bearing posts. We recommend the use of heavy duty ratchet straps or custom cables.

## Care Instructions

Your hammock can be cleaned with cold or room temperature water. A soft rag or your hands can be used to work out any stains, the use of a brush or other abrasive cleaning tool can damage the fabric. For difficult stains, a small amount of Woolite or Revivex Pro Cleaner can be used. We recommend not cleaning your hammock unless it is necessary, regular washings are not needed. When the hammock is clean allow it to dry completely in the shade before repacking it.
